\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Warm-up}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item I conducted the warm-up measurement using the methodology outlined in the assignment. Following that, I ran a benchmark test involving 30 warm-up iterations, 100 measured interactions, and 10 forks.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Measurements}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item Brief description of how the time performance is measured.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Comparison}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item Brief description of how the implementations are compared.
\end{itemize}
\section{Machine specification}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item CPU, memory, OS, etc.
	\item JVM parameters if used.
\end{itemize}
\section{Results}
\subsection{Warm-up}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item The initial results were unsatisfactory. The error was likely due to running the program in WSL with insufficient prioritization and performance, thus being influenced by other factors. Nevertheless, I initiated the benchmarking program with 50 warm-up iterations and 50 forks, monitoring the terminal output to observe how the data changes.

	\item After analyzing the data, I discovered that the program consistently starts very quickly, and the warm-up only affects the initial launch. Subsequent errors are related to other programs running concurrently with the benchmark. The data can be reviewed in the project repository: \url{https://github.com/petrkucerak/ESW/tree/main/hw/hw04/assets}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Measurements}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item Results of the time measurements including a graph with displayed confidence intervals and a table.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Comparison}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item Results of the comparison of the implementations.
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\conciseItem
	\item Summary of the results with a discussion
\end{itemize}
